# Self-Watering System

This self-watering system built for the MarkerSPACE Internship at Dawson college, usues a moisture sensor to detect whether or not your plant or area of soil needs water. If it does, a water pump provides a specific volume. The process will then repeat itself and it will will continue to check the soils moisture.

## Overview and Features

- Uses a Moisture Sensor
- Uses a Mini Water Pump
- Powered by 9 v battery


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- VS Code
- Python

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository. Replace <project> with repo name.

## Contributing

For potential future contributions, I thought of doing some data logging. I would reccomend studying different soils and seeing which one requires more water. I was also planning to study the difference in the number  watterings  between day and night. These are some potential future routes.
